- 👋 Hi, I’m Allyn.
- 👀 I’m interested in fantasy, rpgs, and strategy games. I also love to read fantasy novels, especially the works of JRR Tolkien.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently focused on learning C#. I really love C#.
- I am also learning Erlang. I don't like the syntax of Erlang very much, but I am finding it a fun challenge, and I feel very accomplished whenever I fix my Erlang bugs and get my code running as intended. As I get used to Erlang, I am slowly starting to like it a little more; I guess Erlang is an acquired taste.
- I am learning a little HTML and CSS, though I am not very fond of HTML. I much prefer programming languages.
- I have some experience with Python, and Java as well, though I haven't written anything significant in those languages lately.
- I have some experience with C and C++, though not nearly as much as with other languages. I would definitely like to learn more about these two in the future.
- I am learning Rust next.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help me learn to make video games.
- 📫 How to reach me... I don't know, sorry. I'm still getting used to networking.
- 😄 Pronouns: he
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love learning about Japanese culture.
